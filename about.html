    <div><b>My name is Thomas Buzaki. I am taking this course to finish finish out my
    Bachelors in Computer Science. I have some experience with making websites
    and have active websites already on FAU's lamp server from a previous class.
    The link to it is: https://lamp.cse.fau.edu/~tbuzaki2015/index.html/. A few
    fun facts about me are that I have experience working for Apple as a tech
    support advisor. In this class, I hope to gain more mastery of website development
    and html/css/js usage.</b>
